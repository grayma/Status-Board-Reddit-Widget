Status-Board-Reddit-Widget
==========================

This project is an open-source widget for Panic's Status Board iPad application.  It pulls the top picture from any subreddit that a user chooses, styles, and displays it to be conveniently viewed in a 4x4 DIY panel in the application.

Subreddits can be chosen by providing an argument (the subreddit) to the index.html file like so:  http://yourdomain.com/reddit/index.html?subreddit=[SUBREDDIT HERE (without the brackets)]

The application also supports animated .gifs!
